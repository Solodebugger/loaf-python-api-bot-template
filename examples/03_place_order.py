"""03 — Place, inspect, and cancel an order.

This DOES place a real (limit) order, priced far from the market so it rests on
the book rather than filling. Review it before running against a live account.

    python examples/03_place_order.py

Requires: competition admission when a round is ACTIVE (check
`client.competition.queue_position()`); outside an active round trading is
unrestricted.
